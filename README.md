# Groundstation-Base
Programs for remotely controlling transceiver(s) and rotator(s) using EGSE infrastructure.

Martin Klaper, HB9HSLU & HB9ARK

The program "Groundstation" connects to the EGSE router, from where it receives commands to control radios and rotators.
The brands of radios and rotators as well as the used interfaces are selectable in the configuration file "GroundStation.exe.config".
The program "GroundStationTransceiverController" is a simple test environment, which accepts commands on a command line and sends the commands via the EGSE router to the "Groundstation".
