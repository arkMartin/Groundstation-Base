Programs for remotely controlling transceiver(s) and rotator(s) using EGSE infrastructure
Martin Klaper, HB9HSLU & HB9ARK
The program "Groundstation" connects to the EGSE router, from where it receives commands to control radios and rotators.
The brands of radios and rotators as well as the used interfaces are selected in a configuration file.
The program "GroundStationTransceiverController" is a simple test environment, which accepts commands on a command line and sends the commands
vie the EGSE router to the "Groundstation".
